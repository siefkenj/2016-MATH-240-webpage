		<h3>Typed Assignments</h3>
		<p>
			These assignments are to be typed.  I suggested using the Latex
			typesetting language (more in the <a href="#latex">Latex</a> section).
			You may work in pairs on this assignment.  If you do so,
			both of your names should be included on the assignment and you
			should only turn in <i>one</i> copy of the assignment.  
			These assignments focus is clear communication.  You should aim
			to explain each problem as if you were explaining it to another
			student who hasn't seen the problems before (and as such, you should
			include necessary definitions, etc.)

		<h2>Latex</h2>
		<p>Latex is a programming language designed for typesetting documents.
		It was created (technically the base layer called Tex) by Donald Knuth 
		(considered one of the fathers of computer science).</p>
		<p>
		When you author a document in Latex, you write the content in a text
		file (ending in .tex) and then compile to a pdf.  The compiler 
		lays out all the words on the page and ensures all spacing, etc.
		is consistent.  This means on the one hand 
		that you won't see what your document will
		look like until you compile it, but you also will not need to do
		as much tweaking (as you might in a program like Microsoft Word)
		since the automatic layout algorithm latex uses is quite good
		(your textbook is written in Latex).
		</p>
		<h3>Getting Latex</h3>
		<p>
			You can either use an online version of Latex (which requires 
			no installations), or you can install Latex on your computer.
			I recommend starting with the online Latex distribution
			provided by ShareLaTeX 
			<a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">https://www.sharelatex.com/</a>.
			Sign up for a free account and get started!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want Latex installed locally on your computer, you can
			install one of the Tex distributions for your operating system.
			For Windows, I recommend <a href="http://miktex.org/download">MiKTeX</a>;
			for Linux <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> (which
			should be available through your package manager); and
			for Mac <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/downloading.html">Mac Tex</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p>
			Here are some examples you might find helpful.  To
			view the code for the examples, click the link to the TEX
			file.  Open it in your text editor of choice (for example, notepad)
			and then copy-and-paste to your sharelatex editor, or
			save-as and compile the tex code on your computer.
			The PDF shows what each document should look like after it's
			compiled.  The content of each file is found between the
			<code>\begin{document}</code> and <code>\end{document}</code> lines
			in each TEX file.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A Hello World example. <a href="homework/helloworld-example.tex">TEX</a> and <a href="homework/helloworld-example.pdf">PDF</a>.  This shows the minimum amount
				of code you need to get a document working for this class.
			</li>
			<!--
			<li>
				A sample homework. <a href="homework/sample-homework.tex">TEX</a> and <a href="homework/sample-homework.pdf">PDF</a>.  This shows how much description and writeup
				I expect for the typed homework.
			</li>
			-->
			<li>
				Some fancy math. <a href="homework/fancymath-example.tex">TEX</a> and <a href="homework/fancymath-example.pdf">PDF</a>.  This shows some fancy math possibilities
				in latex as well as how do typeset many common linear algebra
				objects.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Resources</h3>
		<p>
			There is a learning curve associated with Latex (just like
			any computer programming language).  Before you start, I 
			suggest you read the introductory sections to the
			<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">online
			Latex wikibook</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another excellent resource is <a href="https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf">The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For figuring out the command corresponding to the math symbol
			you're thinking of, <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> is indispensable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> is your friend.
			Most of your questions are answered there.  Also, ask your classmates.
			They're having the same struggles that you are!

			Sometimes a video is easier to follow than reading the textbook.  Here are some useful videos
